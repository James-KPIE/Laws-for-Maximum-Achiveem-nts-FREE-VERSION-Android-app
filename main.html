    <p><b style="color:red">THE LAW OF FELLOWSHIP</b><br>
      The word<b> fellowship</b> is a very strong word. In Greek, it is called <b>“Koinonia,”</b>
      which means giving and receiving. It is noteworthy that fellowship with
      God is the greatest privilege He has extended to us, His people. </p>

    <p>When God created man in the beginning, the Bible says, <b>“male and
        female made He them”</b> and He usually came to visit them in the Garden
      of Eden. To what intent was this visit? Indeed, it was for fellowship. </p>
    <p>Eden itself was called a place of fellowship; where life
      began.&nbsp;After God created Adam, He placed him in Eden, where they had
      fellowship. This gave Adam the privilege of knowing God's purpose for him.
    </p>
    <p>But, in Genesis chapter three, when Adam fell, he lost the privilege of
      fellowship with God and became wanting to God as a result. This made God
      to come looking for him. But when God came, Adam was in hiding. And the
      LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, where art thou? (Genesis
      3:9).In response, Adam said, “I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
      afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself” (Genesis. 3:10). </p>
    <p>After several years, Jesus Christ came as the last Adam to restore the
      fellowship with God that the first Adam lost. The privilege of this
      fellowship therefore is now specially available, but only to those who
      accept Jesus into their lives as their Saviour and Lord. Authoritatively,
      Jesus said:</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>…I am the way, the truth, and the life: no<br>
        man cometh unto the father, but by me.<br>
        John 14:6</b>.</p>
    <p>There had to be a path through which we would return to God, the Father
      before fellowship with Him can become our experience. That was what Jesus
      came to make possible. The Cross on which He died for our sins is the
      bridge that connects us to God.</p>
    <p>As Christians, one of our greatest privileges is that privilege of
      fellowship with God. We must also understand that we are called to
      fellowship. God, Himself, said: This people have I formed for myself; they
      shall show forth my praise. Isaiah 43:21.</p>

	  </p>
    <p>From this scripture, we understand that we are created by God for
      Himself; therefore, God desires fellowship with us. This is because, by
      our fellowship with Him, He will manifest His glory in the world through
      us. As we come before God in fellowship, He radiates His glory.</p>
    <p><b style="color:red">FELLOWSHIP BRINGS GLORY</b><br>
      The glory of God is the expression of God's Personality. It is
      the light of God's countenance. It is the beauty of God's
      presence. In Greek language, glory is called CHABOD,
      meaning the Ark of God. God the Creator created His
      creature - man for His glory. Hence the creature and the
      Creator cannot fellowship at the same level. The creature's
      duty in fellowship is that of worship of His Creator. As we
      fellowship with our Creator - The Almighty God, He in
      return begins to release His glory upon us. In fellowship,
      God begins to release the light of His countenance, the
      beauty of His glorious presence upon our lives. Also, He
      makes us to have the privilege of being connected to
      everything He is, so that we can make the most of our lives
      on earth.</p>
    <p>When the glory of God is upon you, it will be so evident that
      no man can pretend not to see it. For instance, Moses went up
      on Mount Sinai and had fellowship with God. In the course
      of that fellowship, the glory cloud of God descended upon
      Mt. Sinai and there was smoke upon the mountain. That
      smoke came as a covering, especially to keep Moses in
      fellowship with God and to shield him from the sight of
      others. While God communed with Moses, he (Moses) was
      privileged to see the handwriting of the Almighty and to hear
      the voice of His majesty. When he descended from the
      mountain, the first thing the people saw on him was the glory
      of God that had come upon him, and they couldn't look at his
      face because of the blazing glory of God upon him.
      Inside that glory, sickness cannot stay. Inside that glory,
      anything that causes shame is swallowed up. Inside that
      glory is the anointing that destroys every form of yoke.</p>
    <p>Inside that glory is the wisdom that makes principalities and
      powers to be subdued. When you come into that moment;
      where you develop that kind of lifestyle of just getting lost in
      God's glory cloud, you become a man or woman to be
      envied, honoured and revered.</p>
    <p>Job said, “When men heard of me they were quiet!” That is
      what happens when God breathes on you; it makes you to
      breathe divine life out of your own system. Thus, people seek
      to listen to you.</p>

    <p>I remember those days before I came into full time Ministry;
      I worked in a Government Parastatal where my two
      immediate bosses were Muslims. They delightsomely
      enjoyed my humble contributions at the management
      meetings on key issues that were strategic to the
      advancement of the organization. After harvesting the views
      of other members of the management team, they often said,
      “Let's listen to what the Doctor has to say,” referring to me.
      This glory cloud we are talking about can't be hidden; even
      sinners can't pretend not to know it.</p>
    <p><b style="color:red">GLORY ENDOWS WITH GOD'S FAVOUR</b>
      I don't know who your employer is; the glory cloud of God
      will distinguish you before him! Joseph was honoured by
      Potiphar, Pharaoh and even the Warder. Do you know why?
      The Bible says that the grace of God was upon Joseph. He
      was God's favourite; thus the favour of God was upon him.
      Just like Joseph, God created you and me for His glory, so we
      can enjoy His favour in the world.</p>
    <p>I want you to understand what God is set to do in this endtime.
      Jesus, the Head of the Church has an agenda: He is
      building a vibrant Church. He is building a Church of glory.
      He is building a pace-setting Church. He is raising a set of
      people that will take charge.</p>
    <p>Have you not heard that you are the city that is set upon the
      hill? Have you not heard that you and I are the apples of
      God's eyes? Nothing matters to God on this earth more than
      you and I. Listen, if you are the kind of person, who has
      signed in for complacency in Christianity, or you are
      satisfied with an average life, then I can tell you that your
      Christianity is going to be very challenging. But if you are
      ready for change, and you want to fly higher, to mount up
      with wings like an eagle, then get ready to operate this
      spiritual law of fellowship to set you on the right path of
      maximum achievement in life</p>

    <p>As you embrace the Word of the Lord and obey His laws, your
      enemies will respect you.<br>
      The Bible says:<br>
      <b>When a man's ways please the LORD, he</b>
      <b>maketh even his enemies to be at peace with</b>
      <b>him. Proverbs 16:7.</b></p>
    <p>
      This implies that your enemies, who naturally don't want to
      see you make progress or experience favour from God, but
      prefer you dead, will be compelled by God to be at peace with
      you. However, this does not happen by chance; there is a price
      you must pay to get to that level.</p>
    <p><b style="color:red">THE PRICE OF GOD'S GLORY</b><br>
      Those Christians who say, “Let us take it easy; you know<
      Rome was not built in a day”, will wake up one day only to
      realize that they have been overtaken by those, who are
      diligent in their walk with God. Then, they will realize that
      God is no respecter of persons; He will only take you as far as
      you are willingly to go.</p>
    <p>Therefore, “I got born again in 1938,” is not an achievement.
      You should be more concerned about being connected to God.<br>
      John 15:1 says:</p>
    <p><b>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husband man.</b></p>
    <p>
      In other words, Jesus is the true Vine. As such it is needful to
      know that there are counterfeit vines. Therefore beware and
      be careful! Be diligent to observe, so you don't get deceived!
      Don't get carried away by activities, sensationalisms and
      emotions.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Jesus said, <b>“My Father is the husbandman.”</b>
      The word “husbandman” here means the gardener. This
      means as the Gardener, God takes away every branch that
      bears no fruit; but the branch that bears fruit, He purges that
      it may bring forth more fruit. (John 15:2)</p>
    <p>In other words, God is inviting you and me to a superproductive
      life. How many of us are ready for more fruits,
      more success, more breakthroughs, more miracles, more
      promotions, more divine elevations, etc.? It is coming your
      way in the name of Jesus! How many of us are ready for
      effective living? The God of heaven is lifting you in the
      name of Jesus!</p>
    <p><b>John 15:4 says:<br>
        Abide in me and I in you, as the branch
        cannot bear fruit on its own except it abide
        in the vine. No more can except you abide in
        me.</b></p>

    <p>
      The level of success you are going to enjoy in life is going to
      be determined by your level of intimacy with God. As you
      know, the closer you are to a mirror, the better you see
      yourself; the closer you get to fire, the warmer you become;
      the longer you stand in the rain after a heavy drought, the
      more lasting you get refreshed. After a long drought, when
      the rain falls and water gathers somewhere, ducks begin to
      come around there to swim and in excitement you see them
      wagging their tails. In the same vein, as you draw close to
      God, you won't see drought in your life anymore! In His
      presence you will have joy and pleasures forever more in
      Jesus mighty name.</p>
    <p>The anointing that flows into us (as the branch) through
      Jesus, the Vine, brings upon us a refreshing that prepares us
      for a fruitful life. Jesus as the Vine is the Source of life to us.
      As long as you are still connected to the vine, you will remain
      a fruitful branch. This is because the closer you are to God,
      the brighter you will shine in life.</p>
    <p><b style="color:red">SEEK HIS PRESENCE, NOT THE PRESENTS.</b>
      Jesus is coming to rapture a Church that is without spot or
      wrinkle. That means He is coming to rapture a mature
      Church. Unfortunately, there is a shift in the Church's
      perception of God; there is a new programme in the Church
      of Jesus.</p>
    <p>Today, there are those, who only attend Church Services for
      the miracles; they come to God because they want
      provisions. But God is saying to you and me: do you want to
      live fruitful life? Do you want to bear fruits? Then, don't seek
      the provisions, seek the Provider. God is saying, “Instead of
      asking for My presents, seek My presence”. Seek the Giver
      and not His gifts.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, there are many, who have only seen the hand o
      God,
      And God said; My hands are not shortened. I stretch forth
      my hand. …And I will not withhold my hand.” But I want
      you to know that there is another level to God other than
      receiving from His outstretched arms; it is seeing His
      FACE! There are people, who have gone beyond seeing the
      hand of God to seeing the face of God.</p>
    <p>For instance, Moses had the privilege of seeing what others
      couldn't see. We are getting to that moment right now,
      because the cloud has shifted. While the children of Israel
      journeyed to the Promised Land, the Bible said that when the
      cloud shifted, they also shifted. I am glad to let you know that
      the cloud has shifted from seeking miracles to seeking the
      Miracle Worker, Himself. It's time to abide in Him, and He in
      us.</p>

    <p>There is an exchange program that takes place when we
      come into God's presence with our hands and hearts lifted in
      worship, singing and just seeking to know Him. When we
      come to that moment, we exchange our human nature for
      His divine nature. In His presence, God wants an exchange
      with us. He wants to take our emptiness and give us His
      fullness; He wants to take our foolishness and give us His
      wisdom. He wants to take our weaknesses and give us His
      strength. He wants to take our defeats from us and give us
      His victory. He wants to take our shortages from us and give
      us His abundance.</p>
    <p>While you are worshipping God, studying His Word or
      praying, you need just a Word encounter from God. It will
      make all the difference in you and in your life. That's why I
      love the song: “Just a word from you Lord, is much better
      than silver and gold...” Just a word from God is more than
      one million dollars. It's more than silver and gold.</p>
    <p>Again, the Bible says, “In His presence is fullness of joy”.
      Do you want your cup to be full of God's blessings? Then,
      lift it up to the Lord. Many come with cups that are almost
      full. If you will care to know, they are only full of concerns,
      murmurings, grumblings, regrets, bitterness and all manner
      of negative things. But God wants us to come with empty
      cups, so that we can be filled.</p>
    <p>When we come before God with empty cups in fellowship,
      as David sang, “As the deer pants after the water brooks so
      my soul pants after thee,” God will fill us up. (Psalm 42:1-2).
      Therefore, be hungry for God. This is because it is hunger for
      God that makes us desperate and it in turn brings us into
      God's presence. It is, therefore time to be desperate for God.
      <p><b style="color:red">DON'T GET DISTRACTED</b><br>
      This is a call to worship; a call to fellowship and a call to seek
      the face of God. As you yield to it positively, you will remain
      refreshed all the days of your life. Hallelujah!

      Amos 5:4 says:<br>
      For thus saith the Lord unto the house of
      Israel, seek ye me, and ye shall live.
      It is time to remove your eyes from men, because God is more
      than able. What men cannot do is a cheap possibility with
      God. It's time to remove your eyes from that doctor's report.
      God says, “Seek ye Me.” Friend, just a breath from Him is
      enough to destroy that incurable disease and every contrary
      report, and you shall live!
	  </p>
      <p>Again, God says, “Seek ye Me”. Friend, as you turn to Him in
      fellowship, that your dead business shall be revived and it
      will begin to live again. That means whatever is dead or is
      dying resurrects in His presence, and whatever is falling
      begins to rise in His presence.</p>
      <p>Are you ready to seek Him? Then, Seek Him as a man seeks
      for oxygen to breathe! What can you do without oxygen?
      What can you do without water? Seek God and everything
      that was called dead shall live and everything that was not
      working shall begin to work. Every case that you couldn't
      handle will be taken care of by God, when you seek Him.
      By applying the law of fellowship or intimacy with God as
      you journey in life, men will respect you! Where you were
      rejected before now, when next you appear there men will
      salute you! You don't come from God's presence and fail; and
      no man can mistake you for a failure. Therefore, are you
      ready for His presence?</p>
    <p>Do you want to enjoy a super - productive life? Then, “Seek
      Me; remove your eyes from My provisions, and seek Me,
      the Provider. Remove your eyes from My miracles and I
      will impart you with what it takes to work miracles” says
      God Almighty.</p>

    <p>Moses sought God and He appeared to him in the burning
      bush and nobody could see the bush beside Moses. From
      today, you will see what other people cannot see and what
      they cannot touch, you will touch. Where other people
      cannot step into, you will step into, in the name of Jesus.
      Moses encountered God and He handed to him a rod with
      which he returned to take charge in the place, where he ran
      away from. He went back to Egypt as a man of authority,
      different from who he was before his self exile. He went back
      already changed; already transformed.</p>
    <p>We will experience a similar change when we behold His
      glory. From today, it is going to be from one change of divine
      lifting to the other for you in the name of Jesus!
    <p>In case you have been rejoicing that God is moving you
      forward, I want to assure you that God is yet going to usher
      you into your best season of life in the name of Jesus! God
      will show you and me that we are worth much more than we
      have attained! Hallelujah!</p>
    <p>In conclusion of this chapter, I would like you to engage your
      night seasons very productively. Remember the Bible says:</p>
    <p><b>“Night unto night showeth knowledge.” (Psalm 19:2).</b></p>
    <p>
      I want to assure you that as you become a great investor into
      the night seasons from now, you will contact God early
      before dawn and take charge of the whole day as a result. The
      devil will see you and clear off your way. I, therefore,
      commend you unto God, and to the Word of His grace, which
      is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all
      them which are sanctified. (Acts 20:32</p>
